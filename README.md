# A non-Newtonian model for computational fluid dynamics simulations of blood flows
Report for a project developed in lifex, a high-performance C++ Finite Element library used for cardiac applications. In this project we implemented and added to the library a Non-Newtonian model in order to model blood viscosity and a solver for the so called Inverse Womersley problem with the purpose of imposing a more accurate Dirichlet boundary condition for the study of computational fluid dynamics simulation of blood flow in vessels.
