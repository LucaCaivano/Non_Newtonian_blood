# A non-Newtonian model for computational fluid dynamics simulations of blood flows
Report for a project developed in **lifex**, a high-performance C++ Finite Element library used for cardiac applications. In this project we implemented and added to the library a **non-Newtonian model** in order to model blood viscosity and a solver for the so called Inverse Womersley problem with the purpose of imposing a more accurate Dirichlet boundary condition for the study of computational fluid dynamics simulation of blood flow in vessels. 

This project was at the basis of my master thesis, "Reduced Fluid-structure interaction and non-Newtonian models of blood flows for simulating the aortic valve", where I used the non-Newtonian model to study a Fluid-Structure Interaction problem in the proximity of a realistic aortic valve.
